# Fizz Buzz

## What is this project?

This is a java program that works by checking if the number is divisible by 3, the program will print out Fizz instead of the number. If the number is divisible by 5, the program will output Buzz instead of the number. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the program will print out FizzBuzz. Otherwise, the program will just print out the number if it is not divisible by 3 or 5.
